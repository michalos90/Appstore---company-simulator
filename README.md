Appstore --- company-simulator

It is a console game in which we play the role of a programmer who creates his own team but starts alone at the beginning.

The game is not to bankrupt yourself and the company that you will own sooner or later

The options that the player has to start are:

1.signing the project, at the beginning they are small projects but with time these projects will be bigger and bigger

2. look for clients, at the beginning nothing comes right away, so sometimes you have to look for people with whom you can earn money

3. to program, at the beginning it is the only thing we can do.

4. test the application for errors. as we do not want our application to contain bugs, it needs to be tested

5. give the project back to the client

6. hire an employee, as we work on larger and larger projects, we will need more and more people.

7. dismiss an employee, sometimes we do not need all of us

8. settlement with ZUS, like any other activity, unfortunately, we will not miss the paperwork.

9. hand over the project to a colleague, e.g. we will not manage to make it with the project, we can give it to a colleague, but it has its pros and cons, the project may be incomplete or we will overpay

10. View all our lists of projects made active or employees
